  Gorgeous: Glance up, and admire a chilled Rocket Lake processor sending its clocks skywards to a stratospheric 6.9 GHz
  and beyond. In two short clips posted to Twitter, overclockers push an octa-core Rocket Lake processor to 6923.56 MHz
  using liquid nitrogen. They use a 113.50 MHz bus speed paired with a 61x multiplier. The 8 GB of system memory is
  similarly overclocked to a devilish 6666.66 MHz.
  The clips are rather devoid of novel information, but as a development, the use of exotic cooling on Rocket Lake
  processors is an intriguing one. It may indicate that a release is imminent. If that's the case, then Intel's keynote
  on Monday, helmed by their executive VP Gregory Bryant, could be the moment.


  Intel is likely to use liquid nitrogen as a marketing ploy for Rocket Lake, so this is your reminder to treat bold
  performance claims with suspicion.

  The last time Intel used exotic cooling for marketing was at Computex 2018. Bryant proudly displayed a 28-core
  processor overclocked to 5 GHz. The industrial cooler it required was, quite literally, hidden under the table. Intel
  claimed it was all a misunderstanding…
